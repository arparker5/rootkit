# rootkit

Andrew Parker, Alex Cater
CS 493 Project draft

For our project, we have decided to examine the inner workings of a rootkit to understand it,
infect a VM with it, and do some analysis on it. We want to look at methods of defending our VM
from the attacks of the rootkit.

For our rough draft, we have taken the code of a rootkit and done some analysis. Our goal for
the rough draft is to have a good understanding of the rootkit code. We have also infected an
Ubuntu VM and messed around with some of the rootkit functionalities.
